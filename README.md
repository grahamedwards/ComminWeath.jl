U-series comminution simulation and interpretation

This package contains a suite of functions that simulate U-series comminution systematics of fine-grained sediments. Incorporates replacement of detrital material with an insoluble authigenic "weathered" phase and implantation of U-series nuclides from a soluble authigenic rind.
